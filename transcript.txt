User: Getting ready to practice on my practice pad today.
AI Assistant: Nice setup! Are you working on any specific rudiments?
User: Yeah, starting with some basic singles and doubles.
AI Assistant: Perfect. Keep those sticks at equal height for consistency.

[00:00:13]
AI Assistant: Your stick angles look slightly uneven. Try matching them.
User: Like this? I'm focusing on keeping them parallel.
AI Assistant: Much better! Ready to try some paradiddles at 80 BPM?
User: Yeah, let me grab my metronome real quick.

[00:00:30]
User: Think I'll start with some rebound control exercises.
AI Assistant: Try hitting dead center on the pad. How's the bounce feel?
User: Feels a bit stiff. Need to loosen my grip maybe?
AI Assistant: Exactly. Let your fingers guide the sticks, not your wrists.

[00:00:51]
AI Assistant: Those practice pad strokes are looking nice and controlled now.
User: Thanks! I'm trying to keep my fingers relaxed and flowing.
AI Assistant: Perfect time to add some dynamics. Try soft-loud-soft pattern.
User: Ooh good idea. Should help with my touch sensitivity.

[00:01:16]
AI Assistant: Notice how your stick height affects the sound quality.
User: Maybe I should work on matching heights between hands?
AI Assistant: Good instinct. Start slow, use the rim as a visual guide.
User: Alright, focusing on that sweet spot above the rim now.
